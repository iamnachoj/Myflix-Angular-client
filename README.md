# My Flix User Interface 
This project was generated with the MEAN Stack. Angular version 12.2.7 was used for the client-side. There is an external API build with node.js + Express and communicated with a Mongo Database.

It is a simple app that displays my favourite movies with the aim of keeping track of them, add them to my fav list and share it with friends.

In order to use it, you will need to register in the welcome page. <a href="https://iamnachoj.github.io/Myflix-Angular-client/welcome">link here!</a>

Once registered, you can log in and see all the movies, with tons of data about directors, genres, and more!. You will be able to add some to your fav list and also change info about your user. (Everything done by CRUD implementation).

## Deployment
Clone repository and store it in your project folder.

Navigate to the file via CLI. Once in the directory, run `npm install` for dependencies. Then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. This way, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
